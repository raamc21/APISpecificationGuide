### 2.Business Service Design
####  2.1 Introduction
  <p> Web services are self-contained modular business applications that have open, Internet oriented, standards-based interfaces. Web services are loosely coupled, communicating directly with other Web services via the Internet using standards-based technologies. This standards-based communication allows Web services to be accessed by customers, suppliers, and trading partners independent of hardware, operating system, or even programming environment. The result will improve time to integration and lower the overall cost of ownership of integration solutions compared to todayâ€™s SOA, EDI and B2B solutions. The result will be an environment where businesses can expose their current and future business applications as Web services that can be easily discovered and consumed by external partners.
